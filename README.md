+ et cetra...

I will working on below models now

# What is this?

This is my collection that emerged from my mind and reflection. Most of works are desigend from the inspiration of Japanese and Greek classics.  
But Understand that ,as I said, my interpretation. Not the fact.

# What is for?
The free materials for those who struggle to create a 3D game.
I'm not done add animations yet, but if you know about how to use 
rigged models you're the one.

# Requirements

I modeled them with Blender 4.0. I cannot ensure that you can edit them with previous version.
You can learn how to make animation by watching videos in Youtube or something.

## For Godot users

You can export the models with .gltf format. Unfortunatelly, we cannot import each material as
it is. If you want to custom models, you need to setup with materials in Godot Editor.
As examples I make several repositories how do I set up them.
It's could be cumbersome work, so I'm planning to find more easierway.

## Some tips

these shortcut keys are useful for me when I maade some animations

| Key | Function |
| --- | ---- |
| Ctrl+Shift+V | paste symmetrically |
| Alt+R | Reset Rotation |
| Alt+G | Reset Position |
| Alt+S | Reset Scale | 

to insert key frame just right click your view and select Insert keyframe.
There are many tutorial videos available on Youtube. Please watch those resources.
And happy animating!

# License 

I'm working on adding animation for each model but you are free to modify or try some motion
creating 3D game is very fun but there are several obstacle we need to get along with.
I hope you enjoy the 3D things witout worring about laborous modeling blah blahs.

But I hope my models are worked for

+ _NOT use of extreme violence_
+ _NOT use of sexual intentions_
+ _NOT malicious or assailment intention to others_
