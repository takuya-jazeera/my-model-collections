# What is this?

This is my collection that emerged from my mind and reflection. Most of works are desigend from the inspiration of Japanese and Greek classics.  
But Understand that ,as I said, my interpretation. Not the fact.

# What is for?
The free materials for those who struggle to create a 3D game.
I'm not done add animations yet, but if you know about how to use 
rigged models you're the one.

I'm working on adding animation for each model but you are free to modify or try some motion
But I hope my models are worked for

+ _NOT use of violence_
+ _NOT use of sexual motives_
+ _NOT malicious or assailment intention to others_
